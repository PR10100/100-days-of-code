# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
August 7, 2018

## Additional Rules (These are from the challenge and I will make my best effort to complete these daily. I omitted posting to twitter everyday as I feel it's sufficient to be linking in the log.md or my web/blog that is actually going to be my project. My added notes are in ().
1. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post. (As I create my actual web page I will be linking to posts I do on that. Until that point I'll just be linking to commit on my GitHub and/or just writing details in the log. Where applicable I will write code in the log if I don't have a substantial enough commit for the day.)
3. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress.
4. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
