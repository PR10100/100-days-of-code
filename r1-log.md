## Log

### R1D0 8/7/18
I committed! I'm doing this challenge in order to build up some repos and hone in more closely on my plethora of dev courses (see detailed list below in the "My Approach..." section) along with revisiting the contents of my Front End Developer, Website Design & WordPress Developer bootcamp I previously studied.

## Progress Notes - Front End Dev Day
1. I did a basic revist of some simple html
    a. Attributes: a href, src, alt, target="_BLANK"
    b. Regular vs. Self-closing tags; <p> ... </p> vs. <img />
    c. Meta tags: <!doctype html>, <meta charset=”utf-8”>, <title> ... </title>, <link />, <html> ... </html>, <head> ... </head>, <body> ... </body>, <script> ... </script> (When I showcase Javascript I'll be adding <script> ... </script> to my meta tags but not right yet.)
    d. Structural tags: <div> ... </div> (I didn't include these for today but more would be: <nav> ... </nav>, <section> ... </section>, <header> ... </header>, <footer> ... </footer>, <article> ... </article>, <aside> ... </aside>)
    e. Text tags: <p>...</p>, <h1>...</h1> (through <h6>),<strong>...</strong> INLINE, <em>...</em> INLINE, <em>...</em> INLINE
    f. Content tags: <img />, <ul> ... </ul>, <ol> ... </ol>, <li>...</li>, <a> ...</a>
    g. HTML Entities: AKA special characters etc. I utilized the ampersand symbol for today.

        https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref 
    h. Images: <img src=" *put your link here and these are saved to the server, so you are telling the server which of your image source files it should grab when it displays this image on the page* " alt=" *what you want to name it*" />
    i. Links: 
        BASIC LINK (opens in same window): <a href=”http://google.com”>Google Knows Everything (almost)!</a>
        NEW WINDOW LINK: <a href=”http://google.com”> target="_BLANK">Check out this link!</a>
        INTERNAL LINK (goes to another page on your website): <a href="about.html">About Me</a>
        EXTERNAL LINK (goes to another page on the web): <a href="http://google.com">Google Knows Everything (almost)!</a>
  
  2. See my code here. I included a. through i. above with the exception of h. (Images).

    
## My Approach: What I'm doing and how

I recently made a cross-country trip in order to relocate from Massachusetts to Colorado!! I started writing and capturing my experiences via my own head then on my social media sites, FB and IG. I'm utilizing these continued experiences to start showcasing my skill sets by creating my first website/blog from scratch. No templates. Just straight code. I'm also taking the opportunity to showcase my website design skills. 

Given that these two endeavors are separate functions and skills sets I will be going back and forth from day to day with working on Front End Dev vs Web Design (UX/UI) and showcasing accordingly. You will see how I conduct the following: planning, sketching/wireframing/prototyping, website setup (domains which I have already, hosting, file setups & pushing code out), creating .html docs like you've seen here today, creating styling & eventually interactions with .css docs, creating unique features to pages with .js docs like basic automation (text manipulation, math calculations, custom greetings) and loading music along with learning a heck of a lot about how my mind works and of course, a lot about my adventures! 

Absolutely share your technical or UX/UI feedback with the understanding that I am still very much a code newbie even with having exposure to lots of things in a work environment along with my own self-study. I primarily teach myself everything on my own time as far as design and dev go. My business analyst and product owner skill sets remain primarily built in an employer setting although, I take my personal development there outside the workplace as well. 

Languages/frameworks/tools I have a working knowledge with: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, PHP, C#, ASP.NET MVC 5, React, Angular, Java, MySQL, MongoDB

Cheers!
